Hi Mom and Dad,

This is one of my news alert solutions. I sent this with sendgrid, an API used for email automation.

My other solution is Mailchimp.


Pros of Sendgrid:

- Looks exactly like an outlook mail merge
- Extremely unlikely to land in a spam filter -- about as unlikley as using mail merge
- No "unsubscribe" button requirement like Mailchimp
- More manual control over the underlying technology, so more possible flexibility
- It's ready to go for the next news alert


Pros of Mailchimp:

- Almost no manual work, compared to Sendgrid
- Much more powerful with a lot of pre-built automation options
- Easier and more robust linkage to EPUB. Dad could fire off a news alert with no other work at all, from anybody


Cons of Mailchip:

- Risk of spam filter
- It requires, by law, to have an "unsubscribe" link, which could be kind of bad if a subscriber clicks it.



Food for thought! Let's solve this problem ASAP...
